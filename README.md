## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZeynabKiani/mlops.git
   cd mlops
   ```

2. **Install prerequisites:**
   - Python (>=3.6)
   - Conda (for MLflow setup).

3. **Run setup script:**
   ```bash
   bash setup_mlops.sh
   ```

## Key Features

- **MLflow Integration:** The `mlflow_model.py` script demonstrates the use of MLflow for tracking model parameters, metrics, and versioning. This script provides a template for logging and managing machine learning experiments.

- **TensorFlow Extended (TFX) Pipeline:** The `tfx_pipeline.py` script showcases a basic TFX pipeline for model training and serving. TFX components are utilized to orchestrate the entire ML lifecycle, including data validation, model training, and deployment.

## Usage

### MLflow Model

Train an MLflow model using the `mlflow_model.py` script. Track experiments, parameters, and metrics effortlessly.

```bash
python src/mlflow_model.py
```

### TFX Pipeline

Execute the TFX pipeline with the `tfx_pipeline.py` script. Experience an end-to-end solution for MLOps using TFX components.

```bash
python src/tfx_pipeline.py
```
